### Note:
1. Page 3 is the swiper using Swiper.js
2. All assets are saved in the asstes/icons folder as .svg
3. The last card's image couldn't be extracted from Figma, hence used a duplicate non-relevant image
4. Installed package for Swiper.js, so if you want to run this project you need to do npm i
